Original Readme
===============

This is a collection of Fokke van Saane's impulse responses in .wav format for use with TL Space, Mellowmuse's IR1A, or whatever convolver you might use. Many of his original files are still in SDII or Altiverb's IRcf format. These have all been converted and saved as mono and stereo files. You may recognize a few of these. Some of his IRs were included in the TL Space factory content.


You can check out his webpage here.
